GreenPoint is a Chrome extension that allows users to conveniently redirect ChatGPT queries to a local model running on Ollama. GreenPoint aims to demystify the environmental consequences associated with AI usage by educating users and allowing them to use more modest models when the level of complexity is appropriate.
